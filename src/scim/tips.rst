User Principal Name
--------------------

A UPN must be unique among all security principal objects within a directory forest.
This means the prefix of a UPN can be reused, just not with the same suffix.

The userPrincipalName attribute is the logon name for the user.
The attribute consists of a user principal name (UPN), which is the most common logon name for Windows users.
Users typically use their UPN to log on to a domain. This attribute is an indexed string that is single-valued.


A UPN consists of a UPN prefix (the user account name) and a UPN suffix (a DNS domain name).
The prefix is joined with the suffix using the "@" symbol. For example, "someone@ example.com".
